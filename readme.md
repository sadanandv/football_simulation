## Introduction

This project aims to develop a comprehensive football simulation environment and reinforcement learning module called **Cognitive Coach**. The primary goal is to simulate how a player, characterized by specific psychometric traits, fits into a football team. Coaches can use this tool to evaluate player integration, team dynamics, and optimize strategies.

---

## Project Overview

- **Simulation of a full 11v11 football match** with realistic rules and mechanics.
- **Agents (players)** with policies influenced by psychometric traits and physical attributes.
- **Teammate and opponent policies** defined by coach strategies and hardcoded behaviors.
- **Evolutionary algorithm (CMA-ES)** for optimizing agent policies without deep learning.
- **Visualization tools** for match playback and performance analysis.
- **Modular codebase** for extensibility and future enhancements.

---


## Environment Design

### Rules and Mechanics

- **Game Duration**: Two halves, customizable length (e.g., 45 minutes each).
- **Field Dimensions**: Standard pitch size (105m x 68m).
- **Ball Physics**: Realistic movement considering speed, direction, friction, air resistance.
- **Player Movement**: Acceleration, deceleration, maximum speed, stamina, fatigue effects.
- **Actions**: Passing, shooting, dribbling, tackling, intercepting, heading, goalkeeping.
- **Rules Enforcement**:
  - Offsides, fouls, yellow/red cards, free kicks, penalties, throw-ins, corner kicks.
  - Substitutions based on fatigue or red cards.
- **Scoring**: Goals when the ball crosses the opponent's goal line within the frame.
- **Match Outcomes**: Win, lose, or draw based on goals scored.

### Implementation Considerations

- **Discrete Time Steps**: Simulation advances in intervals (e.g., 0.5 seconds per step).
- **Physics Engine**: Custom-built to handle movements and interactions.
- **Modular Design**: Separate components for physics, rules, agents for extensibility.

---

## Agent Design

### State Representation

Each agent receives observations at each time step, including:

- **Self State**:
  - Position (x, y coordinates).
  - Velocity and direction.
  - Stamina and fatigue level.
  - Possession status.
- **Teammate States**:
  - Positions and velocities.
  - Roles/positions (e.g., defender, midfielder).
  - Communication signals (affected by team chemistry).
- **Opponent States**:
  - Positions and velocities.
- **Ball State**:
  - Position and velocity.
- **Game Context**:
  - Time remaining in half.
  - Scoreline.
  - Match events (e.g., fouls, cards).

### Observability

- **Partial Observability**: Agents have limited field of view.
- **Communication Channels**: Simulated through team chemistry affecting information sharing.

---

## Action Space

### Action Types

- **Continuous Actions**:
  - **Movement**: Acceleration vectors for speed and direction.
  - **Ball Interaction**: Force and direction when passing or shooting.
- **Discrete Actions**:
  - **Action Selection**: Choose between pass, shoot, dribble, tackle.
